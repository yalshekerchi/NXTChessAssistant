# NXTChessAssistant

NXTChessAssistant (also known as Assistive Chess Piece Relocating System) is a mechanical system that utilizes a robot to move a chess piece from one location to another is described.

## Summary
>The system was created as a solution to help the elderly and people with physical disabilities in their hands, since it would be difficult for them to move the pieces on their own. The system is made up of the robot that moves the piece as well as a wooden frame and custom-built board for the piece to move along. The movement of the piece is achieved with the use of three motors to move the robot under the board on the x, y, and z planes. A magnetic arm is used on the z motor in order to grasp the pieces of the board. On the other hand, the x motor used wheels to move and the y motor utilized a rail.

### Problem Definition
Physical disabilities often limit a person’s ability to participate leisure activities because most require some form of controlled movement. The lack of fine motor skill, in particular, is a very common problem for seniors, stroke survivors, and people with Parkinson’s disease that prevents them from manipulating small objects with ease. In a standard game of chess, fine movement is required to pick up, relocate and place a piece without interfering with other game pieces which can be a problem for many people with this physical disability.

### Project Goals and Objectives
The goal of this project was to design and build a semi-automated system that can accurately move chess pieces on a chessboard by inputting instructions from a user. In order to accomplish this, several objectives were set. This included completing a mechanical design and testing it for the robot before writing the program code. The software design was to be then integrated with the hardware. The final objective was to troubleshoot and implement any mechanical and software re-designs to successfully accomplish the goal.
